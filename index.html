		<h2>Research</h2>
		<h3>Building better postsecondary education systems</h3>
			<p>My projects in this area focus on providing better understanding of college students, their experiences, and their needs. Even as the financial and demographic landscape of higher education has shifted over recent decades, the model of who should be considered the "traditional" college student has stayed the same. Designing postsecondary STEM education programs that are equitable and effective requires reckoning with the ways that material precarity and competing demands on students' time shape the college experience today.</p>
		<h3>Undergraduate biology curriculum and assessment</h3>
			<p>The development of constructivist theories of learning has supported innovations in instructional approaches in undergraduate STEM, including active learning. However, much remains to be discovered about how to best support undergraduate STEM learning in practice. My projects in this area have have explored questions about how assessment and feedback practices influence students' learning in undergraduate biology.</p>
